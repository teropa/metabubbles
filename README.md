Metabubbles
=========

A generative art experiment with Angular 2+.

Based on the "Emergence" chapter in Matt Pearson's wonderful [Generative Art](http://zenbullets.com/book.php) book.

From Tero Parvianier's original tutorial [Metabubbles: Making Generative Art with Angular 
2](https://teropa.info/blog/2016/02/28/metabubbles-generative-art-with-angular-2.html) about this code:

Most people talk about Angular 2 as a platform for writing business applications. But there's no rule that says this is the only thing it should be used for. If you're in 
the mood for something fun, how about making some generative visual art?

You see, the same characteristics that make Angular 2 a useful framework for business app development also make it a fun platform for pure experimentation and 
self-expression through code.

Naturally, since this project is all about self-expression and there is no single correct way to construct it, I encourage you to tweak the visualization to your liking as 
you go through the tutorial, and to share your creation!
